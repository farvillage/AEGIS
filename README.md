# AEGIS

Standalone, native desktop application for real-time network intrusion detection and behavioral threat analysis in private 5G and IoT environments.

## Overview
AEGIS Desktop provides a native, zero-browser user interface built directly for macOS and Windows. Utilizing CustomTkinter for native window rendering and direct in-memory machine learning execution, it eliminates external server overhead while retaining the core behavioral analytics capabilities of the AEGIS research framework.

## Key Features

- True Native Application Window: Runs independently on the operating system without spawning local web browser tabs or background server ports.
- Direct In-Memory Inference: Ingests raw network traffic captures (.pcap, .pcapng) or structured datasets (.csv) and passes them directly to the embedded Random Forest classification engine.
- Piano-Black Operator Interface: Features custom dark styling (#000000 canvas, #0a0a0a panels, and #484aaa purple accents) tailored for security operations centers (SOC).

## Building from Source

To compile AEGIS into a standalone native application binary (.app / executable):

1. Install requirements & PyInstaller:
    ```
    bash 
    pip install customtkinter pandas scikit-learn scapy joblib pyinstaller

2. Clean and compile using the spec file:
    ```
    bash
    rm -rf dist build
    pyinstaller aegis.spec --clean

3. Locate your binary:
    The finished standalone application bundle will be located inside the dist/ folder.
